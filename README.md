# backbone-es6-localstorage-todos-global-es5

Provides the canonical TODOS web app using the global ES5 bundles generated by [backbone-es6](https://github.com/typhonjs/backbone-es6) and [typhonjs-core-backbone-localstorage](https://github.com/typhonjs/typhonjs-core-backbone-localstorage). 

This is a rhetorical demo showing how to consume the library in a global JS context. This is absolutely _NOT_ the recommended way to consume backbone-es6, but gives an example for those converting from global usage to JSPM / SystemJS. Please see
[backbone-es6-localstorage-todos](https://github.com/typhonjs-demos/backbone-es6-localstorage-todos) for the recommended way to work with backbone-es6 and JSPM / SystemJS.

More info coming soon.
